All credits to the person who actually made the game.

I only found the olf .jar file, and couldn't make it run. That's why I decided
to decompile it and bring it back together.

The images referred to in the original file were gone so I had to recreate them
somehow. Luckily there is a video on youtube of the gameplay, so I copied all
the images from the video (that's why the quality is so marvellous), and used
the copies to make my version.

Also, the original .jar was an java applet, a technology that's been deprecated
since 2017, so I converted the game to a full java binary.

Deprecated java.awt events? Replace!
